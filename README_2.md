### A GUIDE FOR USING THE SPAM/BRUTEFORCE RESISTANCE OPTION

###### For the SPAM/BRUTEFORCE option, it checks the resistance of a website or login page to spam attacks (or situations where a hacker uses an automated script or program to try different password combinations).
###### This program then recommends the login page security level by counting the limit of password attempts before the server locks the user out or before a CAPTCHA is provided.
   
#### To use the SPAM/BRUTEFORCE option:

1) You enter a username/email that is valid on the login webpage you'll like to test. This is entered in the section:
	
		Existing username/email to use

2) For the username/email, password and login page:
   
- You need to go to the login webpage to get the html element identifier. You can get the html element identifier either:
   			
		By Name or By CSS Selector	

- To get the html element identifier for email, password or the login button:
	- Go to the login webpage, right click on the field (either email text box, password text box or login button) and click on 'Inspect'
	- Clicking on 'Inspect' will take you directly to the html line where you can find the tag and name defined for the element.
		
	  -- To get the value defined for the name tag of the element, look for name in the html line tag:
				
				E.g: <input data-bn-type="input" autocomplete="section-email email" type="email" name="email" class="css-16fg16t" value="">
	
		In the above example, name tag is: email. Next, put 'email' as the name tag into the application and select 'By Name'
	
	  -- To get the value defined for CSS Selector, right click on the html line tag (located aftering click 'Inspect' as described above) and click: Copy as CSS Selector. Then paste the string into the VunScan application and select "By CSS selector"
	
- Finally, click the button at the end of the application to browse to your Brave or Chrome application in your Desktop folder.
	
3) VOILA: Click on 'Begin VunScan' to begin scanning operation.
