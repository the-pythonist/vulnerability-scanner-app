# vulnerability-scanner-app
#####An application that performs vulnerability scan of domains/websites based on some three (3) parameters



### How to get started running the python code (.py file)

1) Go to the link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/


2) Click on 'Download Python 3.9.6' (download lastest version if 3.9.6 not available, though 3.9.6 is preferred)


3) Install the downloaded Python application
	- Make sure to check/select all relevant checkboxes (Especially: Adding Python to PATH and installing pip)


4) Go to your command line, change directory to the 'vun test' project directory using cd
	- Example:
	  
			cd C:\Users\Aluko\Downloads\vun test

5) Next, run:

   		pip install requirements.txt
   
This will install the dependencies needed to run this application.

#### ENSURE: You do the above before running the VunScan application.



### Now that the environment is set; let's move to actually running the program:

- Go to the project directory and double click on '__ main__.py' to launch the application


- Input a website and select the checkboxes to select what you would like to test against the website.

	- NOTE: 
	  
			For 'PortScan' and 'HTTP/SSL Prescence' options, website MUST be entered in the format:
	  		"www.google.com" with no special characters like '/'
	  
	- NOTE:
	  
			For Spam/Bruteforce Resistance, URL must be in the format:
	  		'http://www.google.com' or 'https://www.google.com',
			and be SURE that the URL you enter points to a login page that ONLY has a Username/Email, Password, and Login Elements

Example login pages: 

		https://accounts.binance.com
		https://www.facebook.com
		https://www.instagram.com


### SPECIAL NOTES: 
- PortScan takes time to achieve. It could take the whole day testing a URL for ports 1 to 10,000
Therefore, be smart when you scan for specify port ranges.
  - I'd appreciate any contribution using 'threading' or some other means to speed it up.
  

- SPAM/Bruteforce might also take time, depending on the limit tries each website installs before locking you out or sending you a CAPTCHA PAGE


### FINALLY: 

- Before clicking the "Begin VunScan" button to begin tests, ensure that:
	* **YOU ARE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET**
	* **YOU HAVE ENTERED THE URL IN THE RIGHT FORMAT FOR THE INTENDED SCAN (following the NOTE sections provided above)**


#### The result from every scan can be found in VunScan Report.txt in the program directory
