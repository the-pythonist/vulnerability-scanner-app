
----- Go to the link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

----- Click on 'Download Python 3.9.6'

----- Install the downloaded Python application

----- Go to your command line, change directory to the 'vun test' project directory using cd
Example: 
cd C:\Users\Aluko\Downloads\vun test

----- Next, run:
pip install requirements.txt
This will install the dependencies needed to run this application.

----- ENSURE: You do the above before running the VunScan application.

----- Go to the project directory and double click on '__main__.py' to launch the application

----- Input a website and select the checkboxes to select what you would like to test against the website.

----- NOTE: For 'PortScan' and 'HTTP/SSL Prescence', website MUST be in the format: "www.google.com" with
no special characters like '/'

----- NOTE: For Spam/Bruteforce Resistance, URL must be in the format: "http://www.google.com" or https://www.google.com,
and be SURE that the URL you enter points to a login page that ONLY has a Username/Email, Password, and Login Elements
Example login pages: https://www.reddit.com/login
		     https://www.facebook.com
		     https://www.instagram.com

----- NOTE: PortScan takes time to achieve. It could take the whole day testing a URL for ports 1 to 10,000
Therefore, me smart when you scan for specify port ranges


----- NOTE: HTTP/SSL Presence 

----- NOTE: SPAM/Bruteforce might also take time, depending on the limit tries each website installs before locking you out or sending you a CAPTCHA PAGE

----- FINALLY: Before clicking the "Begin VunScan" button to begin tests, ensure that:
**** YOU ARE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET
**** YOU HAVE ENTERED THE URL IN THE RIGHT FORMAT FOR THE INTENDED SCAN


----- The result from every scan can be found in VunScan Report.txt
